# Full Stack Open Course

## Introduction

 This repository contains materials and exercises for the Full Stack Open course offered by the University of Helsinki. This course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript, focusing on building single-page applications with ReactJS and REST APIs with Node.js.

## Course Overview

- ##Part 0:** Fundamentals of Web apps

  In this part, I familiarized myself with the practicalities of taking the course and gain an overview of the basics of web development and advances in web application development over the last few decades.

- ##Part 1:** Introduction to React
  In this part,  I familiarized myself  with the React-library and look at some features of JavaScript that are important for understanding React.

- ##Part 2:** Communicating with server
  This part focuses on rendering data collections, submitting data to a React application using HTML forms, fetching and handling data stored in a remote backend server using JavaScript code, and adding CSS styles to React applications.

- ##Part 3:** Programming a server with NodeJS and Express
  Here, our focus shifts towards implementing functionality on the server side of the stack. I implemented a simple REST API in Node.js using the Express library, and the application's data is stored in a MongoDB database. I also deployed our application to the internet.

- ##Part 4:** Testing Express servers, user administration
  This part covers writing unit and integration tests for the backend, implementing user authentication and authorization, and token authentication.

- ##Part 5:** Testing React apps
  In this part, I return to the frontend, looking at different possibilities for testing React code and implementing token-based authentication.

- ##Part 6:** Advanced state management
  Introduction to the Redux library for managing the state of React applications, along with the lightweight version of Redux supported by React, namely the React context and useReducer hook. I also explored the React Query library for simplifying server state management.

- ##Part 7:** React router, custom hooks, styling app with CSS and webpack
  This part covers React Router for dividing the application into different views based on the URL, custom hooks, adding CSS styles to React applications, and configuring the toolchain with Webpack.

- ##Part 8:** GraphQL
  Here, I explored GraphQL, Facebook's alternative to REST for communication between browser and server.

- ##Part 9:** TypeScript
  This part focuses on TypeScript, an open-source typed superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft. I learned to understand, develop, and configure projects using TypeScript.

- ##Part 10:** React Native
  In this part, I learned to build native Android and iOS mobile applications with JavaScript and React using the React Native framework. Concepts such as rendering native user interface components, creating beautiful user interfaces, communicating with a server, and testing a React Native application are covered.

- ##Part 11:** CI/CD
  I gained an understanding of CI/CD systems, their benefits, and how to get started with GitHub Actions for automating the deployment process.

- ##Part 12:** Containers
  Here, I learned how to package code into containers, explore different tools and popular services by utilizing containers, and develop a new viewpoint for web development outside of the now-familiar Node.js backend and React frontend.

- ##Part 13:** Using relational databases
  I explored different NodeJS applications that use relational databases, focusing on using PostgreSQL, the number one open-source relational database.
